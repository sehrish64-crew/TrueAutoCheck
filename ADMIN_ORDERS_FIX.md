## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

All operations work on mobile:
- **Small icons** on mobile, **full labels** on desktop
- **Responsive dropdowns** for status selection
- **Stacked buttons** on mobile
- **Touch-friendly** button sizes

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ Token validation on all endpoints
- ✅ Automatic logout on 401 Unauthorized
- ✅ Input validation for order IDs
- ✅ Status whitelist (only allowed values)
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages (production)

## 📊 Database Operations

### Status Update
```sql
UPDATE orders 
SET status = ?, report_url = ?, completed_at = ?, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = ?
```

### Delete
```sql
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = ?
```

### Order Retrieval (after operation)
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = ?
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Status update doesn't persist
**Check:**
1. Open console (F12)
2. Look for "❌ Status update failed"
3. Check the error message
4. Verify database connection in server logs
5. Check order ID is valid number

### Problem: Delete doesn't remove order
**Check:**
1. Open console
2. Look for "❌ Delete failed"
3. Verify deletion succeeded:
   - ✅ "Order X deleted successfully" = success
   - ❌ Any error = rollback happened
4. Refresh page - order should be gone if deleted
5. Check database to see if record exists

### Problem: Filters not working
**Check:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh page
3. Try single filter first (e.g., just search)
4. Check console for errors
5. Verify `applyFilters()` is being called

### Problem: Error toast keeps appearing
**Check:**
1. Is admin token valid? Check `localStorage.getItem('admin_token')`
2. Are you logged in? Try re-login
3. Is database running? Check server logs
4. Is API responding? Check Network tab in DevTools

## 📝 Code Changes Summary

5. ✅ Check console logs for expected messages
6. ✅ Verify database reflects changes (use MySQL client)

## 📞 Support

If issues persist:
1. Check console logs (F12) for error messages
